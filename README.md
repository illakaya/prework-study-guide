# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was built in order to develop a brief understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git by putting the learning into practice. I am now familiar with the different languages as well as Git Workflow. This webpage is a summary of my learning and understanding.
